			<p class="introprimtextlongtext">The Browse area is where you can inspect your repository's files.</p>
			<p class="introprimtextlongtext">It is vertically divided into two main sections: a list of files (upper part) and a details area (lower part) that shows the contents of the file that was selected in the list above.</p>
			<p class="introprimtextlongtext"><span class="introimportantprefix">IMPORTANT:</span>It's essential to understand how the Sidebar and the Browse area relate to each other. The list of files shown in the Browse area depends on which item is selected in the Sidebar.<br />If the current working branch (HEAD) is selected, you will see the files that are currently checked out on your disk.<br />If, on the other hand, an item other than the HEAD branch is selected in the Sidebar, the files shown cannot be modified since they don't exist on disk, currently. This static list then reflects the state of your repository for the given selected item.</p>
			<br />
			
			<!-- AppleSegStart="File list" -->
			<!-- AppleSegDescription="The file list in the Browse area" -->
			<!-- AppleSegKeywords="files, file" -->
			<div id="pagetitle"> <h1>The file list</h1> </div>
			<ul class="tasklistbulleted">
				<li>
					<p class="listparagraph">Current HEAD branch is selected</p>
					<p class="listparagraph">The shown files are those currently checked out in your working directory. These files could e.g. be modified or newly added to your repository - facts that Tower informs you about in the list. You can perform a lot of actions on these files, e.g. stage, rename, delete, ignore, and many more. </p>
					<p class="listparagraph">You can switch between two alternate display modes: "Modified" or "All". The "Modified" mode shows you only files which are modified, deleted, or new and leaves all unchanged files disregarded. This is perfect when you are actively working with files and want to get an overview of what happened before you commit your changes.
					<br /> <img class="zoomable previewLarge" src="http://git-tower.com/files/applicationHelp/img/browse/browse_list_modified.png" /> </p>	
					<p class="listparagraph">"All" shows you all current files (not only modified ones) in a tree structure.
					<br /> <img class="zoomable previewLarge" src="http://git-tower.com/files/applicationHelp/img/browse/browse_list_all.png" /> </p>
					<p class="listparagraph">Two columns in the table are of special importance: "Staged" and "Status".<br />The "Staged" column indicates if the file has staged changes - changes that will be included in the next commit. The "Status" column indicates how the file was changed (modified, added, deleted, renamed, etc.) and if these changes are staged or not (an icon on the left side means that staged changes are present; an icon on the right means that unstaged changes are present). Note that a file can contain both staged and unstaged changes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="listparagraph">An item other than the HEAD branch is selected</p>
					<p class="listparagraph">The shown files cannot be modified since they don't exist on disk, currently. This static list reflects the state of your repository for the given selected item. That's why you cannot delete, rename, etc. files in this list.</p>

			<div id="pagetitle"> <h1>The details area</h1> </div>
			<p class="introprimtextlongtext">The details area shows the contents / modifications for the selected file from the list above. Again, the displayed information depends on whether the HEAD branch or a different item is selected in the Sidebar.</p>

					<p class="listparagraph">There are four different types of views for a file from your current working directory:</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="numberparagraph">base: shows the file as it is/was in the last commit. <br /> <img class="zoomable previewMedium" src="http://git-tower.com/files/applicationHelp/img/browse/browse_details_base.png" /> </p>

						<li>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="listparagraph">If the file is currently in a conflict state (during a merge conflict) a view "mine/theirs" view, showing the differences between the local and the remote version, is also available.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="listparagraph">An item other than the HEAD branch is selected</p>
					<p class="listparagraph">The details area shows the file contents for the selected Sidebar item.
