			<p class="introprimtextlongtext">During merge (or rebase) operations conflicts can occur. Although Git is very good at solving most issues by itself there are cases when you have to take action. An example situation is when the same line in the same file was edited in both branches - then you need to tell Git how to solve this issue.</p>
			<p class="introprimtextlongtext">Tower will inform you if you currently have a conflict that needs your attention: the conflicted branch is marked with a yellow warning sign icon in the Sidebar. More importantly, when you're viewing your HEAD branch in the Browse area, a yellow colored area just above the file list tells you that "x conflicts need to be solved.".<br /><span class="intronoteprefix">NOTE:</span>Conflicts during rebase operations will temporarily create a "(no branch) HEAD" item in the Sidebar.</p>
			<p class="introprimtextlongtext">To continue working you must solve the conflicts in all concerned files.</p>

						<h2>Step 2: Solve each conflicted file</h2>
						<p class="introprimtextlongtext">Select a file from the list and inspect it in the details area below. The "mine/theirs" view mode is best suited to see how the versions from the merged branches differ. Perform the following actions for each file listed in the table: </p>
						<p class="introprimtextlongtext"><b>A)</b> In very simple cases you might be able to directly decide that one of the versions (mine or theirs) is correct. You can tell Tower by right-clicking the file and choosing "Resolve &lt;file name&gt; Using Mine" or "Resolve &lt;file name&gt; Using Theirs". Continue with the next file or step 3. <br /> <img class="zoomable previewLarge" src="../shrd/refs/refs_branches_merge_resolve_internal.png" /></p>
						<p class="introprimtextlongtext"><b>B)</b> In most cases, however, you'll want to solve the conflict in a merge tool. <br /> <img class="zoomable previewLarge" src="../shrd/refs/refs_branches_merge_resolve_external.png" /> </p>

							<li><p class="numberparagraph">Click the "Merge Tool" button to open the file in an external merge tool.<br /><span class="intronoteprefix">NOTE:</span>You can configure which merge tool to use in Tower's preferences dialog. Be sure that the tool you're using is capable of dealing with merges. Not every diff tool supports merging!</p></li>
							<li><p class="numberparagraph">After having decided how to solve the conflict save your solution in the merge tool and close it.</p></li>
							<li><p class="numberparagraph">Back in Tower, you must mark the file as "solved". You can do that by right-clicking it in the list and choosing "Mark &lt;file name&gt; as Resolved".</p></li>
